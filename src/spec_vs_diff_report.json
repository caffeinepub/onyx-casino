  "summary": "Diff implements a premium dark visual system across layout and pages, adds a shared PageHeader, redesigns Game page to the requested hero/wheel/CTA layout with quick actions, and improves perceived performance via React Query caching/refetch policy updates and replacing some full-page loading states with inline skeletons/spinner-on-initial-load only. One REQ-1 asset (wordmark) is not evidenced in the provided AppLayout snippet. Diff summary also references payment/Stripe-related UI not requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure existing generated header/branding assets (e.g., /assets/generated/onyx-wordmark.dim_1024x256.png) continue to render correctly and fit the new global layout.",
      "reason": "AppLayout snippet shows the background image (/assets/generated/onyx-background.dim_1920x1080.png) but the diff evidence does not show the onyx wordmark being rendered in the new header/layout, so compliance cannot be confirmed from provided diff summary.",
