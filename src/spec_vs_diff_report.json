  "summary": "REQ-1/2/4 appear to be addressed in SpinWheel (label centering, pointer centered at 12 o’clock with separate animated inner wrapper, and up-down bobbing per file summary). REQ-3 is only partially evidenced: code now references a cleaned pointer asset path, but the diff summary provides no evidence the cleaned image file was added/updated. Additionally, SpinWheel introduces unrequested changes to spin/rotation behavior (deterministic landing logic plus random spin count), which conflicts with the stated non-goal about not changing spin determinism/outcome logic.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Remove the grey border/background from the pointer graphic so only the yellow pointer (with glow) remains on a transparent background, and update the app to use the cleaned asset for the wheel pointer.",
      "reason": "The code was updated to reference a cleaned pointer asset path, but the diff summary contains no evidence that the actual cleaned image asset was created/edited (no added/modified image file shown). Therefore the “remove grey border/background” image-edit portion is not verifiable from the provided diff.",

    {
      "description": "Changed wheel spin/rotation behavior to a new “deterministic spin animation that lands exactly at the center of the outcome segment” with outcome-angle mapping and a randomized number of full spins.",
      "reason": "Not requested by any REQ and conflicts with the stated non-goal of not changing game outcome logic or spin determinism. The new logic introduces Math.random() and explicit outcome-to-angle mapping, which is beyond UI-only pointer/label fixes.",
