  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be implemented: GamePage updates ensure the in-button spinner/\"Spinning...\" text stay visible even when the Spin button is disabled, and SpinWheel now shows a consistent PremiumSpinner-based loading indicator until the wheel image is loaded, with timeout/error fallback UI. The diff also introduces additional diagnostics/logging and broader page redesign changes that were not requested.",
