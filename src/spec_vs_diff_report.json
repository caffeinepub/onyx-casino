  "summary": "The diff does not implement a global blurred + dimmed backdrop for overlays (modals/sheets). Changes shown are mainly theme/utility CSS additions in index.css and metadata/summary updates, with no evidence of styling targeting Radix/Shadcn overlay/backdrop elements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a consistent blurred + dimmed backdrop effect whenever an overlay UI is open (e.g., modal dialogs like ProfileSetupModal and slide-over sheets), applied globally via CSS/theme overrides (without editing frontend/src/components/ui), and ensure only the background behind the overlay is blurred/dimmed (not the modal/sheet content).",
      "reason": "No diff evidence of CSS rules that apply blur (e.g., backdrop-filter) and dimming to the overlay/backdrop elements used by dialogs/sheets (typically Radix/Shadcn overlay selectors). The modified index.css content shown contains theme variables and general utility classes but nothing that targets overlay backdrops.",

      "description": "Extensive theme color variable changes and addition of multiple animation/utility classes unrelated to overlay backdrop blur/dim behavior.",

      "description": "Project tracking metadata updates marking the new feature requests as pending (no functional implementation).",

    {
      "description": "Updating/generated repository file summaries that describe many UI changes across the app (e.g., ProfileSetupModal welcome bonus messaging, wheel rendering enhancements, new pages/flows).",
      "reason": "These described features are not part of the BuildRequest to add a blurred/dimmed backdrop; moreover, the diff summary only shows the summaries file being modified, not the underlying implementations.",
